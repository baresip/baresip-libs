# baresip-libs - (work in progress, not ready to use)

This is a meta/mono repo for re, rem and retest.

In 2020, the baresip project forked these projects to continue development.
This new repo provides a new metapackage called **baresip-libs** and provides 
**baresip-re**, **baresip-rem**, and **baresip-test** as separate packages.
